The blockchain is a revolutionary technology that allows for the secure, distributed, decentralized storage of information. Over the past few years, the blockchain has taken the engineering landscape by storm. Many people in the industry predict that the blockchain will disrupt the ways we interact with technology on the same way the Internet did in the early 2000s.

This course is a remastered version of the original *Build a Blockchain and Cryptocurrency from Scratch* course released in early 2018: [https://www.udemy.com/build-blockchain](https://www.udemy.com/build-blockchain).

This takes that course's best content, and adds a ton of additional material:
Some of the main course highlights:
- Code a full-on backend with test-driven development.
- Write a full test suite for the backend.
